Ho rattles sound your warnote
Ho trumpets loudly bray
The clans will strive and gory writhe
Upon the field to day
To day the walls and blackboards
Are hung with flaunting script
From Atlas on the staircase
To Bogeys darkling crypt
Each knight is robed in scarlet
Or clad in olive green
A gallant crest upon each breast
Is proudly heaving seen
While flows our Yellow River
While stands the great Pavil
That Thursday in the Lenten Term
Shall be a beanfest still
From the many willowd margin of the immemorial Thames
Standing in a vale outcarven in a world forgotten day
There is dimly seen uprising through the greenly veiled stems
Many mansiond tower crowned in its dreamy robe of grey
All the city by the fording aged in the lives of men
Proudly wrapt in mystic memry overpassing human ken
Earendel arose where the shadow flows
at Oceans silent brim
through the mouth of night as a ray of light
where the shores are sheer and dim
he launched his bark like a silver spark
from the last and lonely sand
then on sunlit breath of days fiery death
he sailed from Westerland
He threaded his path oer the aftermath
of the splendour of the Sun
and wandered far past many a star
in his gleaming galleon
On the gathering tide of darkness ride
the argosies of the sky
and spangle the night with their sails of light
as the streaming star goes by
Unheeding he dips past these twinkling ships
by his wayward spirit whirled
on an endless quest through the darking West
oer the margin of the world
and he fares in haste oer the jewelled waste
and the dusk from whence he came
with his heart afire with bright disire
and his face in silver flame
The Ship of the Moon from the East comes soon
from the Haven of the Sun
whose white gates gleam in the coming beam
of the mighty silver one
Lo with bellying clouds as his vessels shrouds
he weighs anchor down the dark
and on shimmering oars leaves the blazing shores
in his argent timbered bark
Then Earendel fled from that Shipman dread
beyond the dark earths pale
back under the rim of the Ocean dim
and behind the world set sail
and he heard the mirth of the folk of earth
and the falling of their tears
as the world dropped back in a cloudy wrack
on its journey down the years
Then he glimmering passed to the starless vast
as an isled lamp at sea
and beyond the ken of mortal men
set his lonely errantry
tracking the Sun in his galleon
through the pathless firmament
till his light grew old in abysses cold
and his eager flame was spent
O the hoot O the hoot
How he trillups on his flute
O the hoot of Tinfang Warble
Dancing all alone
Hopping on a stone
Flitting like a fawn
In the twilight on the lawn
And his name is Tinfang Warble
The first star has shown
And its lamp is blown
to a flame of flickering blue
He pipes not to me
He pipes not to thee
He whistles for none of you
His music is his own
The tunes of Tinfang Warble
I am off down the road
Where the fairy lanterns glowed
And the little pretty flitter mice are flying
A slender band of gray
It runs creepily away
And the hedges and the grasses are a sighing
The air is full of wings
And of blundery beetle things
That warn you with their whirring and their humming
O I hear the tiny horns
Of enchanted leprechauns
And the padded feet of many gnomes a coming
O the lights O the gleams O the little twinkly sounds
O the rustle of their noiseless little robes
O the echo of their feet   of their happy little feet
O the swinging lamps in the starlit globes
I must follow in their train
Down the crooked fairy lane
Where the coney rabbits long ago have gone
And where silvery they sing
In a moving moonlit ring
All a twinkle with the jewels they have on
They are fading round the turn
Where the glow worms palely burn
And the echo of their padding feet is dying
O its knocking at my heart
Let me go let me start
For the little magic hours are all a flying
O the warmth O the hum O the colours in the dark
O the gauzy wings of golden honey flies
O the music of their feet   of their dancing goblin feet
O the magic O the sorrow when it dies
You and me  we know that land
And often have been there
In the long old days old nursery days
A dark child and a fair
Was it down the paths of firelight dreams
In winter cold and white
Or in the blue spun twilit hours
Of little early tucked up beds
In drowsy summer night
That You and I got lost in Sleep
And met each other there
Your dark hair on your white nightgown
And mine was tangled fair
We wandered shyly hand in hand
Or rollicked in the fairy sand
And gathered pearls and shells in pails
While all about the nightingales
Were singing in the trees
We dug for silver with our spades
By little inland sparkling seas
Then ran ashore through sleepy seas
And down a warm and winding lane
And never never found again
Between high whispering trees
The air was neither night or day
But faintly dark with softest light
When first there glimmered into sight
The Cottage of Lost Play
Twas builded very very old
White and thatched with straws of gold
And pierced with peeping lattices
That looked toward the sea
