Ho rattles sound your warnote
Ho trumpets loudly bray
The clans will strive and gory writhe
Upon the field to day
To day the walls and blackboards
Are hung with flaunting script
From Atlas on the staircase
To Bogeys darkling crypt
Each knight is robed in scarlet
Or clad in olive green
A gallant crest upon each breast
Is proudly heaving seen
While flows our Yellow River
While stands the great Pavil
That Thursday in the Lenten Term
Shall be a beanfest still
From the many willowd margin of the immemorial Thames
Standing in a vale outcarven in a world forgotten day
There is dimly seen uprising through the greenly veiled stems
Many mansiond tower crowned in its dreamy robe of grey
All the city by the fording aged in the lives of men
Proudly wrapt in mystic memry overpassing human ken
Earendel arose where the shadow flows
at Oceans silent brim
through the mouth of night as a ray of light
where the shores are sheer and dim
he launched his bark like a silver spark
from the last and lonely sand
then on sunlit breath of days fiery death
he sailed from Westerland
He threaded his path oer the aftermath
of the splendour of the Sun
and wandered far past many a star
in his gleaming galleon
On the gathering tide of darkness ride
the argosies of the sky
and spangle the night with their sails of light
as the streaming star goes by
Unheeding he dips past these twinkling ships
by his wayward spirit whirled
on an endless quest through the darking West
oer the margin of the world
and he fares in haste oer the jewelled waste
and the dusk from whence he came
with his heart afire with bright disire
and his face in silver flame
The Ship of the Moon from the East comes soon
from the Haven of the Sun
whose white gates gleam in the coming beam
of the mighty silver one
