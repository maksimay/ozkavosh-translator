During the sacred season, Christians celebrate the greatest miracle in human history
More than two thousand years ago, God sent his only begotten son to be with us
An angel announced the birth of our lord and savior to humble shepherds
He said, I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all of the people
Today in the town of David, a savior has been born to you
He is the Messiah, the Lord
You will find a baby wrapped in clothes and lying in a manger
At Christmas, we thank God for sending us his son to bring peace to our souls and joy to the world
